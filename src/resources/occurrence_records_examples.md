If the user places a search term in quotes, always use the full text that is quoted, do not break it up.

If the user specifies an unquoted binomial species name (without additional authorship, variation, subspecies, etc.
information), try to break it up into its genus and specific epithet.

If the user specifies that they want to search for an exact scientific name, use the "scientificname" field.
